In addition to helping improve the water quality in the bay, it turns out that Maryland residents who want to grow oysters at their dock get a lot of help from the State. Maryland offers a tax credit of $500 per aquaculture oyster float that is designed to grow oysters at a homeowner’s pier. Families with two taxpayers are eligible for up to $1,000 in the credits. Unlike a tax deduction, tax credits can be used directly against a resident’s state income tax liability.<br/><br/>Another goal is to somehow embed water quality monitoring at a low cost to be able to measure the varied effects of water quality and oyster habitats up and down the bay.  The <a href=\"https://chesapeakeconservancy.org/images/Low_Cost_Water_Quality_Monitoring_Needs_Assessment_small1.pdf\">Chesapeake Conservancy</a> published a report on the needs of low cost quality monitoring solutions for the bay.  A key conclusion of the report was that low cost crowdsourcing of water quality data can potentially fill gaps in surface water quality information.  EPA reports that nationally, less than 30 percent of the nation’s surface water bodies are assessed by EPA, states and tribes partly because of the high cost of traditional water quality monitoring.
