            "text": "With tax incentives being available in Maryland for Aquaculture Oyster Floats, the idea to combine water quality monitoring with the Oyster initiative makes good sense.  By creating a \"Connected Oyster Float\", one could not only be helping clean the bay with oysters, but also contribute back valuable water quality monitoring data to help monitor and measure on a regional basis.  While having immediate value to look at the conditions for the oyster, when done on a large scale an initiative like this could provide the Chesapeake Bay Foundation with valuable insights on a micro-regional basis to identify hotspot areas that may be contributing adversely to poor water quality.<br/><br/>Pictured at left is one of <a href=\"https://www.oystergardening.com/\">Captain Tom's Oyster Floats</a> which are quite popular in the area.",

The LORA module and Modbus micro-controller would be waterproofed and encased in the PVC, with waterproof plugs allowing the antennae to extend from the top and the sensor probes to extend into the water.",
