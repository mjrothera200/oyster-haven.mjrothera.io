It turns out that there is a network called <a href=\"https://www.helium.com/\">Helium</a> which is designed to work with these LoraWAN devices.  Helium is a global, distributed network of Hotspots that create public, long-range wireless coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hotspots mine and are rewarded in HNT, the native cryptocurrency of the Helium blockchain. The Helium blockchain is an open source, public blockchain that incentivizes the creation of physical, decentralized wireless networks.",

            "text": "With the Chesapeake Bay being about 2.4 miles wide at its narrowest and about 30 miles wide at its widest, there is an opportunity to use LORA to provide monitoring at an extremely low price point.  With the Helium network, you would need a smaller number of hotspots up and down the bay to be able to cover a lot of LORA enabled water quality monitors.  Pictured at the left is the Helium network coverage as of February 2022.<br/></br/>  As this network grows in popularity, the ability to deploy a LORA enabled water quality sensor and have the network pick it up will become more a reality.  This platform also provides monetary incentives for currently Helium Network Miniing and also in a future phase light-weight packet forwarding, which will also help offset the cost of deploying the monitoring solutions on a large scale.
